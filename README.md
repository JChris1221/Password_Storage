This application is developed by John Chris Pingkian

Overview:
-This encryption algorithm uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode and uses a block of 128 bits for its keys and Initialization Vectors (IV)
-The key is generated by creating a hash using the md5 algorithim of the password of your choice

Encryption:
-The inizialization vector is generated by using the md5 hashing algorithm on the current date and time the stored information was created.
-the initialization vector is then stored at the beginning of the encrypted password
-the encrypted password is saved in a json file.

Decryption:
-The encrypted password is split in the 128th bit to seperate the initialization vector and password for decryption
-The password is decrypted by using the first separated data as initialization vector in the beginning and the stored password at the end
