Overview:
This is a password storage that encrypts your account list into a custom .crsp format in which you can store and import to the program

Encryption:
-This encryption algorithm uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode and uses a block of 128 bits for its keys and Initialization Vectors (IV)
-The key is generated by creating a hash using the md5 algorithim of the password of your choice
-The whole account list is serialized into a json format
-The inizialization vector (IV) is generated by using the md5 hash algorithm on the current date and time the stored information was created.
-The whole account list is then encrypted using the encryption method previously described with the IV generated
-The initialization vector is then stored at the beginning of the encrypted account list for decryption

Decryption:
-The encrypted password is split in the 128th bit to seperate the initialization vector and password for decryption
-The password is decrypted by using the first separated data as initialization vector in the beginning and the stored password at the end
